# Portfolio



Throughout this project I was given the freedom to create a personl portfolio page, and I decided to include most of my gaming information from twitch channel to my console gamertag. This project helped me learn new methods on how to create headers, text alignments, text decorations, nav-links, display felxibility and background images.
